# Multi-Agent RLCard-PyMARL Integration for Card Games

This project bridges [RLCard](https://github.com/datamllab/rlcard) and [PyMARL](https://github.com/oxwhirl/pymarl), providing a flexible and efficient multi-agent reinforcement learning framework tailored for card games such as **Dou Di Zhu (斗地主)**.

## 🔍 Project Highlights

### ✅ Integration of RLCard and PyMARL

* Seamlessly combines **RLCard**, a toolkit for card game environments, with **PyMARL**, a popular multi-agent RL framework.
* Enables efficient multi-agent training for complex environments like Dou Di Zhu.

### ⚙️ Simplified Configuration

* Easy setup of **algorithm**, **hyperparameters**, and **environment** through intuitive configuration files.
* Supports standard PyMARL algorithms.

### 👥 Unified Model for Multiple Roles

* Trains **one single model** to control multiple roles (e.g., **landlord** and **farmers** in Dou Di Zhu), instead of designing separate models like [DouZero](https://github.com/kwai/DouZero).
* This results in **fewer parameters**, **faster training**, and **simpler deployment**.

### 🚀 Efficient Training with Competitive Performance

Our model achieves **\~84% win rate** against RLCard's rule-based AI after just **0.6million games** (roughly **1 day** of training), while DouZero reports **\~90%** with **200 million games over 30 days**.
Despite using only **\~1.5% of DouZero's training samples**, we reach comparable performance — demonstrating remarkable **training efficiency**.

All training is done on **consumer hardware**:
💻 **RTX 4070 Ti Super** + 🧠 **Intel i5-14600KF** on Ubuntu 22.04,
making our approach much more **accessible and lightweight** than previous methods.

### 🧊 Self-Play with Rule-Based AI Warm-Start

* Supports **cold-start training** by using **rule-based agents** from RLCard as opponents in early self-play phases, enabling more stable convergence.
### 🧠 Full-Episode Training vs. DMC

* Unlike DouZero’s **Deep Monte Carlo (DMC)** approach, which estimates Q-values based on individual decisions, we **train using full game episodes**, enabling **credit assignment across the entire trajectory** and better coordination between agents.

### 📊 Training Visualization via Weights & Biases (WandB)


### 📊 Training Visualization via Weights & Biases (WandB)

* Tracks training metrics in real time using [WandB](https://wandb.ai/), fully integrated via PyMARL’s logging backend.
